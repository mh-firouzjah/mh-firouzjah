## Seeking New Opportunities and Relocation Assistance

**If you are hiring or know of any openings, I would appreciate the chance to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs.**

I am a seasoned Python/Django developer actively seeking career opportunities outside my current location. My goal is to find a role with visa sponsorship and relocation assistance to secure a better future for my family. I bring significant expertise and experience in software development and am confident in my ability to contribute effectively.  
If you know of any opportunities or can provide assistance, I would greatly appreciate your support.
